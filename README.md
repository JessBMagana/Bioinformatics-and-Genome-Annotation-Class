# Bioinformatics-and-Genome-Annotation-Class
Class into bioinformatics and genome annotation using Python
This repository holds all of the lessons obtained in this class.

Lab01:
This is the first lesson. This lesson includes four python scripts that
introduces the student to Object Oriented Programing.

    helloMe.py: Creates an object of the class Announcer to print out a name.
  
    helloAgain.py: Creates an object of the class Person to represent a person.
  
    myBio.py: Creates an object of the class Person to build and present a person's biography.
  
    countATBugs.py: Creates an object of the class dnaString that counts the number of
    A and T nucleotides of a given DNA sequence. The script also contains errors that
    the student must find and fix.
  
    countNucleotides.py: Creates an object of the class dnaString that counts
    the number of nucleotides in a given DNA sequence.
  
Lab02:
This is the second lesson. This lesson includes four Python scripts that teaches the
student how to manipulate data types.

    seqCleaner.py: This program cleans up a DNA sequence by removing ambiguous bases
    (denoted by "N") and outputs the "cleaned" sequence, replacing the ambiguous parts
    with a count in {}'s.
    
    fastqParse.py: This program will parse the sequence name information of a
    FASTQ formatted file.
    
    coordinateMathSoln.py: This program takes three sets of atomic coordinates, then
    calculates the bond lengths and angles.
    
    converter.py: This program uses mappings to convert sequence information between 
    different amino acid representations. This includes the 3-letter codon code
    (RNA and DNA), the one letter amino acid code and the 3-letter amino acid code.
    
Lab03:
This is the third lesson. This lesson includes a single Python program called 
nucParams.py that takes a FASTA file as input and calculates the nucleotide content,
the sequence length, the GC content and the amino acid composition.

NCBI_Activity:
This is the fourth lesson. This lesson introduces the student to the National Center
for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The student also learned how to download a FASTA genome
file through the terminal using the command wget. Lastly, the student used their
nucParams.py script on the FASTA genome file for the homo sapien reference genome GRCh38.p13.
